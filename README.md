# TestRepo

Modifying this file for comparing with last commit without staging.
Ok, $git difftool command showed the compartision between this modified file and last commited file.
Now let me stage it and compare it again.
After staging using $git difftool command is not showing any output.
When I wrote the line above, and then run $git difftool then the comparison showed the result between staged version and the modified version. 
Now let me stage it.
